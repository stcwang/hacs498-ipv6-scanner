# hacs498-ipv6-scanner

To run, first set the script to executable with the following command:
```bash
chmod u+x ipv6_scanner.py 
```

When running, specify the probe budget: 
```bash
./ipv6_scanner.py <probe budget> 
```

Run with `-t` to use the small test file instead of the actual data file (e.g., `./ipv6_scanner.py 1000 -t`).
